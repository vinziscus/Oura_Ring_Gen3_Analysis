# Oura_Ring_Gen3_Analysis

Analysing my Oura Ring Gen3 Data to gain actionable insight.

The first 2 months were only tracked through the Oura Ring and no data on top.
I analyzed the first months with the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Continuing onwards I will use further self-reported data (f.E. Energy Levels, Performance in the Gym, Happiness, Sleepiness etc.)

These will be consulted in a future analysis.
